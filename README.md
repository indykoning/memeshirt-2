The project Memeshirt was about making a site for a t-shirt printer.

he wanted people to be able to upload their own image, place text over it and have it printed and sent to their door.
I worked on the creation of that image in a canvas and uploading it to the database, i also did the login, the payment system using Mollie and other minor back-end jobs.

the editing was definitely one of the trickiest parts of building the site since i had to get the image that the canvas returned to the back-end and i couldn't use the default form post to get the image across because it was too much data being sent over but my using XMLhttp i was able to send the image to the back end no problem with.

We used mollie for the payment system which was quite straight forward to set up but of course doing the research, getting the resources ready and actually making it work dit take around 2 weeks.

memeshirt took around 8 weeks to complete and we made this in our 2nd year of learning
